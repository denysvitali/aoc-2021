# Advent Of Code 2021

This repository contains my solution to the Advent Of Code 2021.

## Programming Languages

### Current

#### Python

**Reason:** I solve my AoC mostly on my phone, and sadly Python is
the only language that allows me to do so.

### Planned

#### Rust

**Reason:** I love Rust, but the compile time always makes me 
re-evaluate whether this should be my next all-purposes programming
language. I'll give it a try this year again, and hopefully I'll 
be positively impressed by the compiler build time optimizations.

#### Golang

**Reason:** Well, it's my Go-to language (pun intended) and it
makes the AoC challenging since it's missing sometimes some basic
stuff that would (in otger languages) reault in a less verbose code.
#### Elixir (?)

**Reason:** I always wanted to try it out. Maybe this AoC is a good
chance / excuse to look into this interesting language.

#### Crystal (?)

**Reason:** I didn't use it since quite a while. It could be fun to
see what changed since 0.2.x
